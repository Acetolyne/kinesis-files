# kinesis-files
the keymaps and firmware for both of my kinesis 360 keyboards

The master branch will only contain the keymap used for both keyboards.

Each keyboard will have a firmware branch where the firmware contains all the old firmware. Once tested the firmware files will be uploaded here to preserve the last state.
New firmware will be created via the fork of the original firmware repository as per the Kinesis documentation.
